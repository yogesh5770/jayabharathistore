# 🔐 How to Verify Phone Numbers on Twilio (Trial Account)

Because you are on a **Free Trial**, you cannot call just *anyone*. You can ONLY call numbers you have explicitly verified.

### 1. Go to the Verification Page
Click this link to go directly to the page:
👉 **[Twilio Console: Verified Caller IDs](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/verified-caller-ids)**

*(Or manually go to: Phone Numbers -> Manage -> Verified Caller IDs)*

### 2. Add a Number
1.  Click the **Blue "+" Button** (or "Add a new Caller ID").
2.  **Select Country**: Change the flag to India (+91).
3.  **Enter Phone Number**: Type the number you want to allow (e.g., `7010196231`).
4.  **Verify Method**: Choose **SMS** (Text Message).
5.  Click **"Verify Number"**.

### 3. Enter the Code
1.  Twilio will send a 6-digit code to that phone.
2.  Enter that code on the screen.
3.  Click **Submit**.

### ✅ Success!
Once verified, you will see the number in your list.
Now your Virtual Number (`+1 251...`) is allowed to call this number.

### 📋 Who Needs to be Verified?
For your project to work, you need to verify:
1.  **Your Personal Phone** (The one you are testing with).
2.  **The Delivery Boy's Phone** (`7010196231`).
3.  **Any Professor/Friend** who wants to test the app on their own phone.
